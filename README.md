🌾 Farmer-to-Market Digital Platform

Connecting smallholder farmers directly to buyers in real-time to reduce food loss and hunger.

📖 Overview

Despite global food production being sufficient to feed the world’s population, 828 million people still go hungry each night. A significant challenge lies in the unequal distribution and wastage of food.

In high-income countries, up to 40% of food is wasted at the consumer level.

In low-income countries, food loss occurs during production, harvest, and storage, driven by inadequate infrastructure, poor logistics, and weak market access.

The Farmer-to-Market Digital Platform (Farm2Market) is designed to bridge this gap by:

✅ Connecting farmers directly with buyers in real-time
✅ Providing logistics and storage integration
✅ Leveraging data to better match supply and demand
✅ Empowering farmers while reducing food waste

🚀 Features

Farmer Listings – Farmers can post their available produce (type, quantity, location).

Real-Time Buyer Matching – Buyers can search and connect with nearby farmers.

Logistics Integration – Notifications sent to logistics/storage partners for smooth operations.

Data Dashboard – Analytics to predict demand, optimize distribution, and reduce waste.

Multi-User Access – Farmers, Buyers, NGOs, and Logistics partners.

🔥 Farm2Market — Empowering farmers, reducing hunger, and cutting food waste.

Would you like me to also add API documentation examples (like POST /api/listings, GET /api/farmers) inside this README, so developers can test the backend quickly?
